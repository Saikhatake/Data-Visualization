# 💓 Data Visualization on Heart Disease Dataset

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project presents an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a heart disease dataset with the goal of identifying **key patterns, correlations, and factors** contributing to heart disease. It uses statistical analysis and visual storytelling to uncover relationships in demographic, clinical, and lifestyle attributes.

---

## 📊 Objectives

* Clean and preprocess the dataset
* Explore the distribution of demographic, clinical, and behavioral variables
* Visualize relationships between different features
* Identify factors most associated with heart disease

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Features

The dataset contains various patient-related attributes such as:

* **Demographics**: Age, Gender
* **Clinical Parameters**: Blood Pressure, Cholesterol
* **Lifestyle Indicators**: Smoking Habits, Physical Activity
* **Target Variable**: Presence of heart disease

## 🧪 Key Analysis Steps

1. **Data Import**: Load dataset into a pandas DataFrame
2. **Preprocessing**:

   * Handle missing values and outliers
   * Format and encode categorical features
3. **Descriptive Statistics**:

   * Analyze distributions
   * Summarize key statistics
4. **Data Visualization**:

   * Correlation heatmaps
   * Box plots for outlier detection
   * Distribution plots
   * Trend and comparison charts

---

## 📈 Visual Highlights

* 🔥 **Heatmaps**: Visualize correlations between numerical variables
* 📦 **Boxplots**: Detect outliers in blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.
* 📊 **Histograms & KDE Plots**: Understand variable distributions
* 💡 **Insights**:

  * Age and cholesterol level trends
  * Heart disease prevalence by gender and activity level

---

## 🧠 Results & Insights

* Identified demographic groups with higher risk
* Found key variables highly correlated with heart disease
* Suggested potential features for machine learning modeling

---

## 📌 Future Work

* Implement classification models to predict heart disease
* Include time-series data (if available) for trend analysis
* Combine with other public health datasets for broader analysis
