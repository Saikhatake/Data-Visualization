Heart Disease Dataset: Exploratory Data Analysis
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on a heart disease dataset. The aim of the project is to analyze patterns and correlations in the data to better understand the factors contributing to heart disease.

Project Overview
This project involves:

Preprocessing the dataset.
Analyzing demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors.
Visualizing trends and correlations between features.
Dataset
The dataset includes various features such as:

Patient demographics (e.g., age, gender).
Clinical measurements (e.g., cholesterol levels, blood pressure).
Lifestyle information (e.g., smoking habits, physical activity).
The dataset and project were originally hosted on Kaggle. You can find the Kaggle notebook and dataset here.

Tools and Libraries
The following Python libraries are utilized:

pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing.
numpy for numerical operations.
matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations.
Jupyter Notebook for an interactive analysis environment.
Key Steps in the Analysis
Loading the Data: Importing the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Data Cleaning: Addressing missing values, outliers, and formatting issues.
Descriptive Analysis: Summarizing key statistics and metrics.
Visual Exploration: Using plots and charts to analyze feature relationships.
Insights and Conclusions: Identifying key patterns and summarizing findings.
Visualizations
The project features:

Distribution plots for understanding variable ranges.
Heatmaps for visualizing correlations between features.
Box plots for identifying outliers in clinical measurements.
How to Use This Repository
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-eda.git
Navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter Notebook:
cd heart-disease-eda
jupyter notebook
Run the notebook to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
Results
The analysis provides:

Insights into the distribution of heart disease cases.
Key factors that correlate strongly with the presence of heart disease.
Potential areas for further predictive modeling.
Future Work
Implement predictive models for heart disease classification.
Extend the analysis to include external datasets for comparison.
Investigate temporal trends if time-series data is available.
